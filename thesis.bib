	abstract = {The paper traces the development of large multi-transputer systems for high-performance scientific and engineering computing. After defining what we mean by ‘supercomputing’ in the context of this paper, the past and present state of transputer supercomputing environments is illustrated by a discussion of three specific projects. These are the Esprit ‘SuperNode’ project or P1085, the Edinburgh Concurrent Supercomputer project and the Victor project at IBM Research in Yorktown Heights. The present parallel programming environments available for transputer systems are also briefly reviewed. The paper concludes with a look to the future. Inmos’ announced plans for the next generation transputer, code-named H 1, are described along with a comparison with the new Intel iWarp chip. We can classify this Intel component as a ‘generic’ transputer in that it integrates computing elements, memory elements and communication hardware on a single VLSI chip. Both these new components should make for a bright future for supercomputing with transputer-like building blocks.},

The S/Net is a multicomputer, designed and built at AT\&T Bell Laboratories, that is based on a fast, word-parallel bus interconnect. We describe the Linda-supporting communication kernel we have implemented on the S/Net. The implementation suggests that Linda's unusual shared-memory-like communication primitives can be made to run well in the absence of physically shared memory; the simplicity of the language and of our implementation's logical structure suggest that similar Linda implementations might readily be constructed on related architectures. We outline the language, and programming methodologies based on distributed data structures; we then describe the implementation, and the performance both of the Linda primitives themselves and of a simple S/Net-Linda matrix-multiplication program designed to exercise them.},

	abstract = {Generative communication is the basis of a new distributed programming langauge that is intended for systems programming in distributed settings generally and on integrated network computers in particular. It differs from previous interprocess communication models in specifying that messages be added in tuple-structured form to the computation environment, where they exist as named, independent entities until some process chooses to receive them. Generative communication results in a number of distinguishing properties in the new language, Linda, that is built around it. Linda is fully distributed in space and distributed in time; it allows distributed sharing, continuation passing, and structured naming. We discuss these properties and their implications, then give a series of examples. Linda presents novel implementation problems that we discuss in Part II. We are particularly concerned with implementation of the dynamic global name space that the generative communication model requires.},
